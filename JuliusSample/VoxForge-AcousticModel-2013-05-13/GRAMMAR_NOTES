VoxForge & Julius Quick Start - Julian Grammar

The enclosed sample grammar files are for demonstration purposes only.  They allow the 
Julius speech recognition engine to recognize the following type of sentences 
(and many more):

 * CALL STEVE YOUNG
 * DIAL FIVE SEVEN EIGHT TWO
 * DIAL THREE ZERO 
 * DIAL TWO TWO FOUR FOUR NINE ZERO SEVEN SEVEN 
 * PHONE JOE YOUNG JOHNSTON JOHNSTON JOHNSTON STEVE STEVE STEVE JOE 
 * CALL BOB JORDAN
 * CALL STEVE
 * CALL STEVE JOHNSTON
 * PHONE STEVE 
 * DIAL OH OH FOUR FIVE SIX 

Basically, the grammar is designed to recognize any combination of the numbers 1 through 9,
ZERO and OH.  You must precede numbers with the word 'DIAL' - as in "dial 1 2 3".  It is 
also set up to recognize any combination of the following names: STEVE, YOUNG, BOB, 
JOHNSTON, JOHN, JORDAN, and JOE.  You must precede the names with the words "PHONE" 
or "CALL" - as in "phone steve young" or "call johnston".

If you want to add more words to your grammar, you can only use the words (and phones) 
contained in the VoxForge Dictionary - see http://www.repository.voxforge1.org/downloads/builds 
to download the latest version.  This was the dictionary used to train the acoustic model 
you are using.  If you want to use words that are not included in this dictionary, you 
will likely need to recompile the acoustic model with audio that uses the words you 
want to add.  The VoxForge how-to and tutorial can walk you the steps required to do 
this, see our web site at: http://www.voxforge.org/home/acousticmodels.

Remember, your recognition quality will be only as good as the Acoustic Model you use, 
and we need much more GPL transcribed speech audio to create decent quality Acoustic Models.  
So please take the time to submit some transcribed speech to www.voxforge.org.

thanks,

the VoxForge team.
