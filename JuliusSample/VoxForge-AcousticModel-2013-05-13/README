VoxForge & Julius Quick Start.

This Zip file contains everything you need to get Julius working:
 * Julius Run-time engine executable;
 * VoxForge Acoustic Model files;
 * VoxForge sample Grammar files.

Simply extract the zip file to a directory, start a Windows Command Prompt 
(i.e. click Start>All Programs>Accessories>Command Prompt), and change directory 
to the folder where you extracted the zip file (e.g. cd c:\julius-4.2-quickstart-windows), 
and execute the following commands:
 
 c:>julius -input mic -C Sample.jconf

For information on the Julius grammar syntax, see the enclosed GRAMMAR_NOTES.

Note that the Acoustic Models are still 'alpha'.  As a result, the quality of speech 
recognition is only fair.  This is not a fault of the Julius Speech Recognition Engine, 
it is because we need much more GPL transcribed speech audio to create decent quality 
Acoustic Models.  So please take the time to submit some transcribed speech to www.voxforge.org.

thanks,

the VoxForge team.
